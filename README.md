## Personal Profile

Currently a student of Makers Academy, studying Data Engineering while working as a WordPress developer for a few small-scale clients. I am hardworking with excellent problem-solving skills, strong observational and collaborative skills, and a quick hands-on learner. These skills have allowed me to pursue private projects both individually and within a small team. However, I am longing to develop a more substantial career in Data Engineering. My previous experience in management roles has led to well-developed teamwork skills and good communication habits. I am keen to help others in both work and community projects. I am also developing my AI interaction skills and have been a weekend greengrocer at Barnet Market since 2007, which has led to great client-facing communication skills and a fond, kind-hearted attitude towards community interaction.
